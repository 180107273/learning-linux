learning-linux
===========
Repository created in order to learn Linux and collect resources connected with it

It's not going to be next awesome-* list. This list is created for my own learning purposes and I'm not going to put here everything, but if someone else will find it useful, it's good.

Resources
---------
- [Source code of the Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
- [The art of command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) - absolutely must read
